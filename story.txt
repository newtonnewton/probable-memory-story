This is the 7th year of Mr.Wang's voyage on Mars, the red planet. After lost connection to the earch, the entire team of explorers now have to live on their own.

On the first day that they live on themselves, they try to use the seed from the fruits and vegetables that they bring from the earth. Two days late, all of plants that they grown are died. Therefore, they invent a new technology that help plant grow on the Mars. That technology called Mlant. This is a combination of Mars and Plant. This technology use carbondioxide instead of water to the grow the plant. After three trials, they found that this technology is successful. 

With the help of Mlant, the voyagers have a new found hope. They are no longer in danger of starving at least. The biggest and next task is re-establishing connection with Earth. Mr. Wang knows that this
needs to be accomplished using radio waves, but he is not sure how...
